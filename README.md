# Hand-Held-MRI

This repository contains files for constructing and running a single-sided, hand-held MRI sensor using a Magritek, Kea 2 Spectrometer. Below describes the repository.

3D Model Files: This contains a Autodesk Inventor file and a .stl file for the housing to the sensor. If you do not want to make any changes to the housing, you can directly print the part using the .stl file. If you would like to make changes to the design, you can edit the file using Autodesk Inventor.

PCB Files: This folder contains the gerber files needed to manufacture the different PCBs in this project. 

Magritek Prospa Files: This folder contains the prospa pulse sequence files used in this project. It contains 2 separate pulse sequences for the x and y experiments. 

Matlab Processing Files: This folder contains the matlab files needed to process the data collected with the Kea 2 spectrometer. The main function in the folder is PEImageAnalysis.
